# ✅ Task 3: Sentiment Analysis Using NLP 

This task focuses on performing Sentiment Analysis on a textual dataset using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify the sentiment expressed in text (such as movie or product reviews) as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

This task is part of a data analytics internship project that demonstrates the power of machine learning and NLP in understanding user opinions and feedback from large volumes of unstructured text data.

# 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

**Python**

**Pandas** – for data handling

**NumPy** – for numerical operations

**Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization

**NLTK** – for natural language processing and sentiment classification

**Scikit-learn** – for ML modeling and performance evaluation

# 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset used contains textual data (e.g., reviews or tweets), each labeled with a corresponding sentiment. It includes:

Text – The actual text data (user review, tweet, etc.)

Sentiment Label – Categorical variable: Positive, Negative

# ⚙️ Task Performed

**Data Preprocessing**

Removed unnecessary characters and punctuation

Converted text to lowercase

Removed stopwords

Tokenization and Lemmatization

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Distribution of sentiment classes

Word cloud and most frequent words per sentiment

Sentiment Labeling

**Model Building**

Split data into training and testing sets

Vectorized text using TF-IDF

Trained a Logistic Regression model for sentiment classification

**Model Evaluation**

Calculated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score


# 📊 Results

Achieved satisfactory accuracy in classifying the sentiments.

Visualizations helped in understanding word frequency and sentiment trends.

The TextBlob-based sentiment assignment was compared with machine learning predictions.

# 🎯 Conclusion

This task highlights how NLP and sentiment analysis techniques can be used to derive meaningful insights from unstructured text. By classifying the sentiment of reviews or tweets, businesses can better understand public opinion and improve their products or services accordingly.

# Outcome

Cleaned and processed the dataset

Model performance plots

Sentiment predictions on sample texts
